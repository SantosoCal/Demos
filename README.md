# Demos

LocationMenuBarDemo:

A demo that includes getting the user's current location, displaying custom annotations on a map, a custom menu bar with scrolling horizontal bar, and multiple embedded collection views. Note: events are placed in Berkeley, CA. XCode Simulator does not get user's current location, only works on iPhone devices.
